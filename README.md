# Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks

This project is part of course CS F425 Deep Learning at BITS Goa.

In this project, we learned that Cycle Consistency Adversarial Networks tries to solve image-image translation problems without paired data. The objective function it uses is the Adversarial losses and Cycle consistency losses. Image-Image translation is used in Object Transfiguration, Photo Enhancement, Style Transformation, Season Transformation and Image Segmentation. We made the model and tested it on a new city dataset and performed image segmentation.
